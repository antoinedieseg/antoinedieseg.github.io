			<h3><strong>Mechanical Watches ⌚️</strong></h3>
			<p>I enjoy learning about watches as well as collecting them. So far, I only have a few in my collection, however, I hope I will be able to make it grow during the following years. If I had to choose a single grail timepiece I would choose the Patek Philippe Nautilus 5712.</p>

			<h3><strong>Geopolitics 🌏</strong></h3>
			<p>Having lived in Japan for 15 years, I've been used to the frequent various political tensions with China, Russia, South Korea and North Korea. Learning about the geopolitics and the interests of a country is a great way of understanding its culture and its point of view on certain subjects.</p>
		</div>
		<div class=card-white>
			<h3><strong>Cars 🏎</strong></h3>
			<p>Cars have been my biggest passion since I was a kid. I always enjoyed learning about cars and their history. It is somewhat tied to my passion of timepieces.</p>
